# 0x11 - printf

## Description

> This team project is part of the first year curriculum of ALX printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

## Prototype

`int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

## Usage

- Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
- All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`
- Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
- Call it this way: `_printf("format string", arguments...)` where `format string` can contain conversion specifiers and flags,
  along with regular characters

## Examples

- `_printf("Hello, main\n")` _prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line_
- `_printf("%s", "Hello")` _prints "Hello"_
- `_printf("This is a number: %d", 98)` _prints "This is a number: 98"_
